Authd is an authentication daemon for cloud-based identity providers. It helps
ensure the secure management of identity and access for Ubuntu machines
anywhere in the world, on desktop and the server. Authd's modular design makes
it a versatile authentication service that can integrate with multiple identity
providers. MS Entra ID is currently supported and several other
identity providers are under active development.

## Documentation

Documentation for authd is currently available as a [wiki](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/01---Get-started-with-authd) that includes how-to guides on:

- [Installation](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/02---How%E2%80%90to-install)
- [Configuration](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/03---How%E2%80%90to-configure)
- Login through [GDM](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/04---How%E2%80%90to-log-in-with-GDM) and [SSH](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/05--How%E2%80%90to-log-in-over-SSH)

A reference for [troubleshooting](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/06--Troubleshooting-reference) is also provided along with an explanation of authd's [architecture](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/wiki/07-Architecture-explanation).

## Brokers

Authd uses brokers to interface with cloud identity providers through a [DBus API](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/blob/HEAD/internal/examplebroker/com.ubuntu.auth.ExampleBroker.xml).

Currently [MS Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis) is supported as an identity provider. 
The [MS Entra ID broker](https://github.com/ubuntu/oidc-broker) allows you to authenticate against MS Entra ID using MFA and the device authentication flow.

For development purposes, authd also provides an [example broker](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/tree/main/examplebroker) to help you develop your own.
