[![Documentation Status][docs-image]][docs-url]

authd is an authentication daemon for cloud-based identity providers. It helps
ensure the secure management of identity and access for Ubuntu machines anywhere
in the world, on desktop and the server. authd's modular design makes it a
versatile authentication service that can integrate with multiple identity
providers. MS Entra ID is currently supported and several other identity
providers are under active development.

## Documentation

If you want to know more about using authd, refer to the
[official authd documentation][docs-url].

The documentation includes how-to guides on installing and configuring authd,
in addition to information about authd architecture and troubleshooting.

## Brokers

authd uses brokers to interface with cloud identity providers through a
[DBus API](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/blob/HEAD/examplebroker/com.ubuntu.auth.ExampleBroker.xml).

Currently [MS Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis)
is supported as an identity provider.
The [MS Entra ID broker](https://github.com/ubuntu/oidc-broker) allows you to
authenticate against MS Entra ID using MFA and the device authentication flow.

For development purposes, authd also provides an
[example broker](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/tree/main/examplebroker) 
to help you develop your own.
