[![Documentation Status][docs-image]][docs-url-stable]

authd is an authentication daemon for cloud-based identity providers. It helps
ensure the secure management of identity and access for Ubuntu machines anywhere
in the world, on desktop and the server. authd's modular design makes it a
versatile authentication service that can integrate with multiple identity
providers. `MS Entra ID` and `Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management` are currently
supported and several other identity providers are under active development.

## Documentation

To find out more about using authd, refer to the
[official authd documentation][docs-url-stable].
If you are on an edge release then you can also read the
[latest development version of the documentation][docs-url-latest],
which may include features not yet available in the stable release.

The documentation includes how-to guides on installing and configuring authd,
in addition to information about authd architecture and troubleshooting.

## Brokers

authd uses brokers to interface with cloud identity providers through a
[DBus API](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/blob/HEAD/internal/examplebroker/com.ubuntu.auth.ExampleBroker.xml).

Currently [MS Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis)
and [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview)
are supported as identity providers.
They allow you to authenticate using MFA and the device authentication flow.

For development purposes, authd also provides an
[example broker](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/tree/main/examplebroker)
to help you develop your own.
