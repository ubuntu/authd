# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 21.0.0 (2025-02-18)

<csr-id-05e247e5c7a74ac7bf9a906417724b8a275cabcc/>
<csr-id-2252ba1d9cf93256a8bcdd721813ed2397e32464/>

The breaking release is to avoid side-effects with different `pulldown-cmark` versions.
This crate now comes with version 13.

### Other

 - <csr-id-05e247e5c7a74ac7bf9a906417724b8a275cabcc/> Adjust wording + typos

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-2252ba1d9cf93256a8bcdd721813ed2397e32464/> Add helper to factor out newline + padding pattern
   When writing a newline into the generated Markdown content
   to start a new line of output, it is (almost) always necessary
   to output the "padding" characters used to indent the content
   at the current location in the document, based on the hierarchy
   of block-level elements the output cursor is "inside" of.
   
   Since writing a newline and writing the current padding are
   always paired, factoring them out into a function should help
   with readability and consistency in performing this minor
   two-step dance correctly.

## 20.0.0 (2024-12-15)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-fdc5859ff9823189c6966d5448468bff1d82d899/> Add structured error handling for cmark(), cmark_resume() etc
   When `cmark_resume_with_options()`, which serves as basis for the other
   `cmark*` functions, finds an inconsistent event stream (for example, two
   consecutive heading start tags), it panics.
   
   Introduce a custom error type `Error` in the crate and change the return
   type of all public functions from `fmt::Result<_>` to `Result<_, Error>`.
   
   The next commit adds an integration test.

   That way, future additions to the rather internal state won't be a reason for breaking changes anymore.

## 18.0.0 (2024-10-16)

<csr-id-b3d7df263409e2f9ebdaae843e087c714b994367/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-b3d7df263409e2f9ebdaae843e087c714b994367/> use `TextMergeStream` for round-trip tests
   This increases the amount of passing tests to 578.
   It doesn't strictly improve the quality of implementation,
   but since separate text events aren't supposed to be semantic,
   these failures seem spurrious.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d8f22c18562ebc50c1ca6960bd745adab706a5b6/> angle brackets if link paren is unbalanced
   Increases passing spec tests from 473 to 477.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-2f75de249b1925dad69a43add3a22ace27e42904/> write block quote kind only once

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-db767944612b0e0068d7872ec515e3f0c23865b4/> correctly round-trip code blocks with no trailing newline
 - <csr-id-8a9573d0b1b6095248ba2869c63da8399d31acfb/> round-trip indented code blocks
   This raises the number of passing spec tests from 459 to 473.

### Other

 - <csr-id-21a7f26a611e7a5b99ab33e9386acd30f0188960/> Lower MSRV to 1.71.1
   This project builds successfully with the MSRV of `pulldown-cmark`. Therefore we can lower `rust-version` to 1.71.1.
   
   Add documentation for the current MSRV and that this project follows MSRV policy of `pulldown-cmark`.
   
   Use `cargo hack` for MSRV CI job, to automatically install rustc according to `rust-version` and then execute `cargo check`.

## 14.0.0 (2024-06-10)

This release adds support for keeping escapes in the original source for the input events,
assuming the new `cmark_resume_with_source_range_and_options()` function is used.

Please also note that for most this won't be a breaking change as only a field was added
to `State`, which isn't used unless you do incremental event serialization.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6c8297c03eb82ac95fa9dd559e3337e470d70c72/> clarify what `last_event_end_index` indices into and how it's used
   This is marked as breaking change as the field itself is new in `State`
   and could be breaking for some.

## 10.0.0 (2022-01-28)

Note that the breaking change is fixable by removing the last parameter from the `cmark()` function if it was `None`, 
or using `cmark_resume` instead.

### New Features

- Formatting within links is no being preserved.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7166abeb0f89ee1dfb7790923d0d5fc6edc394c5/> Simplify `cmark(…)` by removing `State` parameter, introduce `cmark_resume(…)`.
   
   The reason for doing it this way around causing a breaking change is
   the change of behaviour for `cmark_resume`, which now returns a state
   instance that needs a `finalize()` call to flush certain caches.
   
   Currently this is only used to write link blocks, after which the state
   is still usable for future invocations if necessary.
   
   That way the caller has control over where to put link blocks, or other
   items that should be placed at the end of a logical section.

<csr-id-93f2d11e467221418748c672a3c493dcfbf9d6e7/>

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0a6f80d67eed9234170c95d8282cbc76ae66d47c/> Shortcut handling is now using the `State`.
   
   This makes resumable event processing work as expected, even though
   the output won't be similar as it will print shortcuts right after
   all events have been processed and it's impossible to know
   how often it will be called.
 - Simplify `State`.
  
   Use an `Option` to get rid ofa  boolean and make isuse impossible.
