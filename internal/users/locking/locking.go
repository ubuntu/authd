// Package userslocking implements locking of the local user and group files
// (/etc/passwd, /etc/groups, /etc/shadow, /etc/gshadow) via the libc lckpwdf()
// function.
//
// It is recommended by systemd to hold this lock when picking a new UID/GID to
// avoid races, even if the new user/group is not added to the local user/group
// files. See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/docs/UIDS-GIDS.md.
