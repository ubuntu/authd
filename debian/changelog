authd (0.4.0) plucky; urgency=medium

  * Generate random UIDs and GIDs. This fixes an issue which can lead to login
    failing because of UID/GID collisions.
  * Fix login with non-authd user failing when authd is unavailable
  * Fix login failing if a group has been renamed on the provider's end
  * Avoid creating users or groups which already exist (with the same name,
    but different UID/GID) on the system.
  * Use more restrictive sandboxing for the authd systemd service
  * Use journal native protocol to print nice log messages to the systemd journal
  * Update Go dependencies:
    - toolchain go1.23.5

authd (0.3.7) noble; urgency=medium

  * Change database directory from /var/cache/authd to /var/lib/authd.
    The database is not a cache, removing it has an impact on security
    because it allows users to be assigned the UID of a previous user
    This is now reflected by storing the database below /var/lib instead
    of /var/cache.
  * Fix user being removed from local groups during login
  * Fix defaulting to local broker even after local user is removed
  * API: Support exposing if the UI supports QR code rendering
  * PAM module:
    - Fix races
    - Many small fixes
  * Update dependencies

authd (0.3.6) noble; urgency=medium

  * CVE-2024-9312: Avoid UID collisions with other users on the system
    - Make UID/GID ranges configurable. This package now ships a config file,
      /etc/authd/authd.yaml, which allows to configure the minimum and maximum
      UID and GID values that are assigned to users and groups.
      While the default range (1000000000-1999999999) should usually not be
      used by anything else by default, it's the admin's responsibility to
      ensure that the configured UID/GID ranges don't overlap with the ranges
      used by other system components.
    - Don't remove expired users. Removing users from the database allows other
      users for which the same UID is generated to log in and gain access to
      the deleted userâ€™s files.
    - Don't clear the database on corruption. Same as above, that would allow
      unauthorized access to users with colliding UIDs.
  * Keep UID and GIDs if the user already exists in the authd database. This
    fixes an issue affecting authd 0.3.5 which caused users who already logged
    in with a previous version of authd to be assigned a new UID, causing file
    permission errors because the home directory (and other files owned by the
    user) is owned by the old UID.
  * Clean up orphaned user records. On systems which are affected by the above
    issue, two users with the same name but different UIDs exist in the authd
    database. With this release, authd automatically removes the old UIDs from
    the database. Users who didn't change the owner of their home directory
    (and other files owned by the user) yet need to do so. To facilitate this,
    authd checks the owner of the home directory when a user logs in and
    prints a warning to the journal which explains how to fix the ownership.
