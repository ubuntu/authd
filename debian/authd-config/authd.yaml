## UID and GID allocation range for users and groups.
##
## These define the minimum and maximum UID and GID values assigned
## to users and groups by authd.
##
## Ensure that these ranges do not overlap with other ID ranges in use,
## such as those specified in /etc/subuid or /etc/subgid.
##
## Note: The user private group (the group named after the user) is always
## created with the same GID as the userâ€™s UID, regardless of the GID_MIN
## and GID_MAX values.
#UID_MIN: 1000000000
#UID_MAX: 1999999999
#GID_MIN: 1000000000
#GID_MAX: 1999999999
