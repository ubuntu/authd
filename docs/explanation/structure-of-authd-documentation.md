# Structure of authd documentation

## Diátaxis for documentation structure

This documentation uses the [Diátaxis structure](https://diataxis.fr/).

* A [how-to guide](/howto/index) provides you with the steps necessary for completing specific tasks.
* A [reference](/reference/index) gives you concise and factual information to support your understanding.
* An [explanation](/explanation/index) includes topic overviews and additional context on the software.

## Tabs for provider-specific content

The documentation makes extensive use of tabs for provider-specific content.

We expect authd to support a growing list of providers. Tabs are a convenient
way to both show that multiple providers are available and also to enable users
to choose the documentation that is relevant to them.

When you select a tab for a specific provider/broker, the rest of the
documentation will synchronise with that selection. The selection persists
across pages and refreshes.
