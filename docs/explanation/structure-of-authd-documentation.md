# Structure of authd documentation

The authd documentation uses the [Diátaxis structure](https://diataxis.fr/).

Currently, the documentation consists of how-to guides, references, and explanations:

* A [how-to guide](/howto/index) provides you with the steps necessary for completing specific tasks.
* A [reference](/reference/index) gives you concise and factual information to support your understanding.
* An [explanation](/explanation/index) includes topic overviews and additional context on the software.
