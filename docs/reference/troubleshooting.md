# Troubleshooting

This page includes tips for troubleshooting authd and the identity
brokers for different cloud providers.

## Logging

### authd

```authd``` logs to the system journal.

For ```authd``` entries, run:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u authd.service
```

If you want logs for authd and all brokers on the system, run:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u authd.service -u "snap.authd-*.service"
```

For specific broker entries run the command for your chosen broker:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo journalctl -u snap.authd-google.authd-google.service
```
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo journalctl -u snap.authd-msentraid.authd-msentraid.service
```
:::
::::


For the GDM integration:

```shell
sudo journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell
```

For anything else or more broader investigation, use ```sudo journalctl```.

### Logging verbosity

You can increase the verbosity of the logs in different ways.

#### PAM module

Append ```debug=true``` to all the lines with `pam_authd_exec.so` or `pam_authd.so` in the PAM configuration files (`common-auth`, `gdm-authd`...) in ```/etc/pam.d/``` to increase the verbosity of the PAM messages.

#### NSS module

Export `AUTHD_NSS_INFO=stderr` environment variable on any program using the authd NSS module to get more info on NSS requests to authd.

#### authd service

To increase the verbosity of the service itself, edit the service file:

```shell
sudo systemctl edit authd.service
```

Add the following lines to the override file and make sure to add `-vv` at the end of the `authd` command:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/authd -vv
```

Then you need to restart the service with `sudo systemctl restart authd`.

#### GDM

Ensure the lines in `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` are not commented:

```ini
[debug]
# Uncomment the line below to turn on debugging
# More verbose logs
# Additionally lets the X server dump core if it crashes
Enable=true
```

Then you need to restart the service with `sudo systemctl restart gdm`.

#### authd broker service

To increase the verbosity of the broker service, edit the service file:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo systemctl edit snap.authd-google.authd-google.service
```
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo systemctl edit snap.authd-msentraid.authd-msentraid.service
```
:::
::::

Add the following lines to the override file and make sure to add `-vv` to the exec command:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/snap run authd-google -vv
```
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/snap run authd-msentraid -vv
```
::::

You will then need to restart the service with:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

`sudo snap restart authd-google`.
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

`sudo snap restart authd-msentraid`.
:::
::::

## Switch authd to the edge PPA

Maybe your issue is already fixed! You can try switching to the [edge PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-enterprise-desktop/+archive/ubuntu/authd-edge), which contains the
latest fixes and features for authd, in addition to its GNOME Shell (GDM)
counterpart.

```{warning}
Do not use the edge PPA in a production system, because it may apply changes to
the authd database in a non-reversible way, which can make it difficult to roll
back to the stable version of authd.
```

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-enterprise-desktop/authd-edge
sudo apt update
sudo apt install authd gnome-shell
```

Keep in mind that this version is not tested and may be incompatible with the current released version of the brokers.

To switch back to the stable version of authd:

```shell
sudo apt install ppa-purge
sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-enterprise-desktop/authd-edge
```

```{note}
If using an edge release, you can read the
[latest development version of the documentation](https://canonical-authd.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)
```

## Switch broker snap to the edge channel

Maybe your issue is already fixed! You should try switching to the edge channel of the broker snap. You can easily do that with:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo snap switch authd-google --edge
sudo snap refresh authd-google
```
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo snap switch authd-msentraid --edge
sudo snap refresh authd-msentraid
```
:::
::::

Keep in mind that this version is not tested and may be incompatible with the current released version of authd. You should switch back to stable after trying the edge channel:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo snap switch authd-google --stable
sudo snap refresh authd-google
```
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo snap switch authd-msentraid --stable
sudo snap refresh authd-msentraid
```
:::
::::

```{note}
If using an edge release, you can read the
[latest development version of the documentation](https://canonical-authd.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)
```

## Common issues

### Only the first logged-in user can get access to a machine

This is the expected behavior.

By default, the first logged-in user is defined as the "owner" and only the
owner can log in.

For other users to gain access after authentication, they must be added to
`allowed_users` in the `broker.conf` file.
This is outlined in the [guide for configuring authd](ref::config-allowed-users).

See below the relevant line in the configuration, showing both the owner and
an additional user:

```ini
[users]
allowed_users = OWNER,additionaluser1@example.com
```

If an administrator is the first to log in to a machine and becomes the owner,
they can ensure that the next user to log in becomes the owner by removing the
`20-owner-autoregistration.conf` file:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

:::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo rm /var/snap/authd-google/current/broker.conf.d/20-owner-autoregistration.conf
```
:::

:::{tab-item} MS Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo rm /var/snap/authd-msentraid/current/broker.conf.d/20-owner-autoregistration.conf
```
:::
::::


This file is generated when a user logs in and becomes the owner. If it is
removed, it will be regenerated on the next successful login.

### File ownership on shared network resources (e.g. NFS, Samba)

The user identifiers (UIDs) and group identifiers (GIDs) assigned by authd are
unique to each machine. This means that when using authd with NFS or Samba, the
UIDs and GIDs of users and groups on the server will not match those on the
client machines, which leads to permission issues.

To avoid these issues, you can use ID mapping. For more information, see
* [Using authd with NFS](../howto/use-with-nfs)
* [Using authd with Samba](../howto/use-with-samba)

## Recovery mode for failed login

If authd and/or the broker are missing, corrupted, or broken in any way, a user may
be prevented from logging in.

To get access to the system for modifying configurations and installations in
such cases, there are two main options:

1. Log in as root user or another local user with administrator privileges
2. Boot into recovery mode to get root access

The steps required for entering recovery mode are included below.

### Boot into recovery mode

If it is not possible to log in with the root user account or another local
user account with administrator privileges, the user can boot into recovery
mode:

1. Reboot the device
2. During the reboot, press and hold the right <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key
3. When the Grub menu appears, select `advanced options for Ubuntu`
4. Choose `recovery mode` for the correct kernel version
5. Select `drop to root shell prompt`

The user then has access to the root filesystem and can proceed with debugging.
