# Configure authd for cloud identity providers

This guide shows how to configure identity brokers to support authentication of
Ubuntu devices with authd and your chosen cloud provider.

```{admonition} Logging in multiple users with authd
:class: tip
By default, the first user to authenticate and log in to a machine becomes the
"owner" and only they are allowed to log in.

For other authenticated users to log in, they must first be added as an
"allowed user".

The steps you need to follow when allowing more users are outlined in
[configure allowed users](ref::config-allowed-users) on the current page.

```

## Broker discovery

Create the directory that will contain the declaration files of the broker(s):

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/authd/brokers.d/
```

Then copy the `.conf` file from your chosen broker snap package:

:::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

::::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo cp /snap/authd-google/current/conf/authd/google.conf /etc/authd/brokers.d/
```

::::

::::{tab-item} Microsoft Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo cp /snap/authd-msentraid/current/conf/authd/msentraid.conf /etc/authd/brokers.d/
```

::::
:::::

This file is used to declare the brokers available on the system. 

```{note}
Several brokers can be enabled at the same time.
```

## Application registration

This section demonstrates registering an OAuth 2.0 application that your chosen
broker can then use to authenticate users.

:::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

::::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

### Google IAM

Register a new application in Google IAM. Once the application is registered, note the `Client ID` and the `Client secret`. These values are respectively the `<CLIENT_ID>` and `<CLIENT_SECRET>` that will be used in the next section.

To register a new application go to the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

Click `Create credentials > OAuth client ID`.

![Menu showing selection of Create credentials > OAuth client ID.](../assets/google-app-registration.png)

Select the `TVs and Limited Input devices` application type.

![Menu showing app type.](../assets/google-choose-app-type.png)

Name your OAuth 2.0 client and click `Create`.

Your app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret` will be shown on your page, store them somewhere as you will need them in the next step.

![Screen showing app credentials.](../assets/google-app-credentials.png)

For more detailed information please refer to the [OAuth 2.0 for TV and Limited-Input Device Applications documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device).


::::

::::{tab-item} Microsoft Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

Register a new application in the Microsoft Azure portal. Once the application is registered, note the `Application (client) ID` and the `Directory (tenant) ID` from the `Overview` menu. These IDs are respectively a `<CLIENT_ID>` and `<ISSUER_ID>` that will be used in the next section.

To register a new application, in Entra, select the menu `Identity > Applications > App registration`

![Menu showing selection of App registrations under Applications.](../assets/app-registration.png)

Then `New registration`

![User interface showing selection of New registration in App registrations.](../assets/new-registration.png)

And configure it as follows:

![Configuration screen for the new registration.](../assets/configure-registration.png)

Under `Manage`, in the `API permissions` menu, set the following Microsoft Graph permissions:

![Configuration screen for Microsoft Graph permissions.](../assets/graph-permissions.png)

Ensure the API permission type is set to **Delegated** for each permission.

Finally, as the supported authentication mechanism is the device workflow, you need to allow the public client workflows. Under `Manage`, in the `Authentication` menu, under `Advanced settings`, ensure that `Allow public client flows` is set to **Yes**.

[The Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) provides detailed instructions for registering an application with the Microsoft identity platform.

## Broker configuration

Now we can configure the broker. Note that different brokers can require different configuration data.

:::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

::::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

To configure Google IAM, edit  `/var/snap/authd-google/current/broker.conf`:

```ini
[oidc]
issuer = https://accounts.google.com
client_id = <CLIENT_ID>
client_secret = <CLIENT_SECRET>
force_provider_authentication = false
```
::::

::::{tab-item} Microsoft Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

To configure Entra ID, edit  `/var/snap/authd-msentraid/current/broker.conf`:

```ini
[oidc]
issuer = https://login.microsoftonline.com/<ISSUER_ID>/v2.0
client_id = <CLIENT_ID>
force_provider_authentication = false
```
::::
:::::

## Force remote authentication with the identity provider

By default, remote authentication with the identity provider only happens
if there is a working internet connection and the provider is reachable during login.

If you want to force remote authentication, even when the provider is unreachable,
enable it as follows:

```ini
[oidc]
...
force_provider_authentication = true
```

```{warning}
In some cases, this may prevent login, such as when there are network issues.
```

(ref::config-allowed-users)=
## Configure allowed users

The users who are allowed to log in (after successfully authenticating via the
identity provider) are configured in the `users` section of the
`/var/snap/authd-<broker_name>/current/broker.conf` file:

```ini
[users]
## 'allowed_users' specifies the users who are permitted to log in after
## successfully authenticating with the Identity Provider.
## Values are separated by commas. Supported values:
## - 'OWNER': Grants access to the user specified in the 'owner' option
##            (see below). This is the default.
## - 'ALL': Grants access to all users who successfully authenticate
##          with the Identity Provider.
## - <username>: Grants access to specific additional users
##               (e.g. user1@example.com).
## Example: allowed_users = OWNER,user1@example.com,admin@example.com
#allowed_users = OWNER

## 'owner' specifies the user assigned the owner role. This user is
## permitted to log in if 'OWNER' is included in the 'allowed_users'
## option.
##
## If this option is left unset, the first user to successfully log in
## via this broker will automatically be assigned the owner role. A
## drop-in configuration file will be created in broker.conf.d/ to set
## the 'owner' option.
##
## To disable automatic assignment, you can either:
## 1. Explicitly set this option to an empty value (e.g. owner = "")
## 2. Remove 'OWNER' from the 'allowed_users' option
##
## Example: owner = user2@example.com
#owner =
```

By default, the first person to log in to the machine is automatically registered
as the owner. If you wish to override this behavior then specify a list of allowed
users with the `allowed_users` option, while omitting the `OWNER` keyword:

```text
allowed_users = person1@email.com,person2@email.com
```

Alternatively, you can directly register someone as the owner by using the `owner`
option:

```text
owner = your@email.com
```

Explicitly setting an empty owner, has the same effect as omitting the `OWNER` keyword
in `allowed_users`:

```text
owner = ""
```

## Restart the broker

When a configuration file is added you have to restart authd:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart authd
```

When the configuration of a broker is updated, you also have to restart the broker:

:::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: broker

::::{tab-item} Google IAM
:sync: google

```shell
sudo snap restart authd-google
```

::::

::::{tab-item} Microsoft Entra ID
:sync: msentraid

```shell
sudo snap restart authd-msentraid
```

::::

## System configuration

By default on Ubuntu, the login timeout is 60s. This may be too brief for a device code flow authentication. It can be set to a different value by changing the value of `LOGIN_TIMEOUT` in `/etc/login.defs`
