# Install authd and brokers for cloud identity providers

This project consists of two components:
* **authd**: The authentication daemon responsible for managing access to the authentication mechanism.
* **identity broker**: The services that handle the interface with an identity provider. There can be several identity brokers installed and enabled on the system.

authd is delivered as a Debian package for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server.

## System requirements

* Distribution: Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS or Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
* Architectures: amd64, arm64

## Install authd

You can install authd from the [stable PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-enterprise-desktop/+archive/ubuntu/authd).

To add this PPA to your system's software sources, run the following command:

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-enterprise-desktop/authd
```

```{note}
The stable PPA release of authd can be used today as an authentication service.
This project is under active development and the release of authd to the
official archive is planned for Ubuntu 26.04 LTS.
```

Then install authd and any additional Debian packages needed for your system of
