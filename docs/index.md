# authd

authd is a versatile authentication service for Ubuntu, designed to seamlessly integrate with cloud identity providers like OpenID Connect and Entra ID. It offers a secure interface for system authentication, enabling cloud-based identity management. It can be used to support logins through both GDM and SSH.

authd features a modular structure, facilitating straightforward integration with different cloud services. This design aids in maintaining strong security and effective user authentication. It's well-suited for handling access to cloud identities, offering a balance of security and ease of use.

authd uses brokers to interface with cloud identity providers through a [DBus API](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/blob/HEAD/internal/examplebroker/com.ubuntu.auth.ExampleBroker.xml). Currently, both [MS Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis) and [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) are supported. For development purposes, authd also provides an example broker to help you develop your own.
These brokers allow you to authenticate against MS Entra ID or Google IAM using multi-factor authentication and the device authentication flow.
