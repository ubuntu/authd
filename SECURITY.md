## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, we encourage responsible disclosure. Please report any security issues to help us keep `authd` secure for everyone.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

The most straightforward way to report a security vulnerability is via [GitHub](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/security/advisories/new).
For detailed instructions, please review the [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) documentation.
This method enables you to communicate vulnerabilities directly and confidentially with the `authd` maintainers.

The project's admins will be notified of the issue and will work with you to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security issue and, if so, in which component.
We will then handle figuring out a fix, getting a CVE assigned and coordinating the release of the fix to the various Linux distributions.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we expect from you.

#### Steps to Report a Vulnerability

1. Go to the [Security Advisories Page](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/security/advisories) of the `authd` repository.
2. Click "Report a Vulnerability."
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, affected versions, and potential impact.
